Steganography is the art of hiding the fact that communication is taking place, by hiding information in other information. Many different carrier file formats can be used, but digital images are the most popular because of their frequency on the internet.
"Watermarking" is the process of hiding digital information in a carrier signal; the hidden information should, but does not need to, contain a relation to the carrier signal.

This Project is done by Mahendra Kumar and Aditya Singh both from BCA from University of Allahabad in 2022 year.
